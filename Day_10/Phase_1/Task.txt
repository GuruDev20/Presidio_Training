Design a normalized schema

Support querying of training data

Ensure secure access

Maintain data integrity and control over transactional updates

Database planning (Nomalized till 3NF)

A student can enroll in multiple courses

Each course is led by one trainer

Students can receive a certificate after passing

Each certificate has a unique serial number

Trainers may teach multiple courses

Tables to Design (Normalized to 3NF):

1. **students**

   * `student_id (PK)`, `name`, `email`, `phone`

2. **courses**

   * `course_id (PK)`, `course_name`, `category`, `duration_days`

3. **trainers**

   * `trainer_id (PK)`, `trainer_name`, `expertise`

4. **enrollmentsnrollment**

   * `enrollment_id (PK)`, `student_id (FK)`, `course_id (FK)`, `enroll_date`

5. **certificates**

   * `certificate_id (PK)`, `enrollment_id (FK)`, `issue_date`, `serial_no`

6. **course\_trainers** (Many-to-Many if needed)

   * `course_id`, `trainer_id`
